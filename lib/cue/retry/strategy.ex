  Defines the behavior required by retry strategy modules.

  A retry adapter is responsible for:

    * Classifying the result of a job execution as either retryable or terminal.
    * Returning a delay (in seconds) to wait before the next retry attempt.

  Strategy modules must implement this behaviour to be used with
  `Cue.Retry.Policy`.

  Interprets the result of a job function.

  Returns `:ok` if the job was successful or should not be retried,
  or `{:error, reason}` if it should be retried.

  The result is passed directly from the job functionâ€™s return value.

  Returns the number of seconds to wait before retrying a failed job.

  The delay may be constant, linear, exponential, or calculated in any
  way the adapter chooses. It must be a non-negative integer.
